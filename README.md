# Optifyx-Image-Gallery-Filtering
This project is an interactive image gallery that allows users to filter images based on categories like Nature, Animals, and City. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. When a filter button is clicked, JavaScript checks the image’s category and toggles its visibility.  The “All” button shows every image in the gallery again.
